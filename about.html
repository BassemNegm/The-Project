            Here in DIY, we're devoted ourselves to teach people the basics of independency 
            and how to do home maintenance and small little projects on their own, 
            we started as a very small startup back in 21st of Oct 1995, and since then, we're spreading
            the love of crafts amongst men, women and kids. Out main office is in Ireland and from there
            we've spread all over the country then all over the world, we've went up and down
            to reach more people as much as we can and help spreading the knowledge. Our motto
            is "If they can do it, we can do it and better". And so far, we had many successful
            stories that we're proud to share each and every day on all our social media platforms.
            Wish you all success and happiness, and always know that you can count on us!
